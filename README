Encode and Decode functions written and ran in python 3.5.2
Decode works by reading the rgb values and adding the values to a list that is converted from binary to decimal.
The decimal is then converted to the amount of pixels needed to read, values read are added to a new list and then values are converted from binary to ascii.

Encode takes in user input as a string, gets the length of the string and converts that length into binary to be written to the image.
The same function takes place for the actual string.


Run decode.py and supply a file name to decode the message.

Run encode.py and supply a string to write and a name for the image that will be created at the end of the program.
